                <p class=" font-monospace">Our cow farmers are all approved by the Swedish health department and the County-board. 
                We are very keen on keeping healthy cows to produce the best meat. We only buy from farmers that keep their cows in a big facility with alot of outdoor time.
                We alos prefer that cows eat ecological food and hay.
