# User Story
## Goal
Goal of the site is for the resturant to provide users a management system where they can make bookings and manage them, read menu and some imformation about the returante.

## User Stories
* User should be able to sign up and later on sign in and sign out:

* When a table is booked user can manage the bookings troughout 'My page': 
As a user I can edit my booking so that I can make changes
As a user I can see my bookings so that I can manage them
As a user I can delete my booking so that I dont have that booking anymore



## Agil Method
Agil methodology aims to complete tasks in small steps. Thats the main method I used for this project. I set up my maintasks and tried to solve them one at a time. The method is designed for projects with alot of uncertinti. Where the user of the method is unsure how the outcome will happend. Therefor it is easyer to take small steps trought the project to learn what the outcome of one step will be before moving on to the next. I set up a project board with task that I had for the project to work. I had 4 main task, the 'big' tasks that the whole project evolved around. And this tasks led me to smaller tasks.

# Design

Design was choosen when the team got more clear. I have changed my design a couple of times but when I was sure about my resturante concept, it was easyer to design.  I went for a feeling of modern, neutral, nostaligcal feeling that is pleasent to look at


## Wireframes
My first outcast of wirefram looks like this. Then I worked with this wirefram as my base and the improved it so it would fit the concept.

## Bugs
|Test | What to do | Status |
|----|:---------|:-------|
|Broken navbar link | The error was in the base.html, it was not connected to the right template. Insted of href='{% url account_login%} It just said href=#.| fixed |
|Got a Template dose not exist error when trying to opend 'My Bookings' page in the navbar| Had not yet connected my view function for the 'My Bookings' to an URL path in URL in the bookAtable folder | fixed|
|Function for redirecting to 'My page' did not work| when I was writing my book_a_table function I wrote 'return redirect('my page') when I should have written ('my_page') the underscore was missing and was throwing an error.| fixed |
|ProgrammingError | When trying to book a table I got a programmingerror. Fixed it by resetting the database. I did it trough heroku. Went to resources on my heroku page, then clicked on the postgres link and clicked on 'Reset database'. Later I had to creat a new superuser and also makemigrations and migrate again. Probably caused by changes in the model after migrations| fixed |
