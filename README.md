# User Story
## Goal
Goal of the site is for the resturant to provide users a management system where they can make bookings and manage them, read menu and some imformation about the returante.

## User Stories
* User should be able to sign up and later on sign in and sign out: 
As a user I can sign up so that i can sign in, sign out and book a table
* When signed in user should se a option for booking a table: 
As a sitevisiter I can book a table so that I know I have a place to sit
* When a table is booked user can manage the bookings troughout 'My page': 
As a user I can edit my booking so that I can make changes
As a user I can see my bookings so that I can manage them
As a user I can delete my booking so that I dont have that booking anymore



## Agil Method
Agil methodology aims to complete tasks in small steps. Thats the main method I used for this project. I set up my maintasks and tried to solve them one at a time. The method is designed for projects with alot of uncertinti. Where the user of the method is unsure how the outcome will happend. Therefor it is easyer to take small steps trought the project to learn what the outcome of one step will be before moving on to the next. I set up a project board with task that I had for the project to work. I had 4 main task, the 'big' tasks that the whole project evolved around. And this tasks led me to smaller tasks.
